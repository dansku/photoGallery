# Jekyll Photo Gallery

I want to share my jekyll photo gallery, simple, functional, mobile friendly and most essential, pretty! The gallery is based on the design from [Henrrique Gusso](https://gus.so/) and utilizes the [jekyll gallery generator plugin](https://github.com/ggreer/jekyll-gallery-generator) to do most of the heavy lifting (with some minor changes).
